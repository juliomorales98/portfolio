        <p>
          In the game, a pirate boat has exploded and the pieces landed on
          diferent islands of the archipelago. Each of the players (max 4) take
          the roll of a pirate of the tripulation and have to retrieve the
          boat's pieces and assemble it again in a limited time. But, every of
          the pirates has a different condition that changes the gameplay, there
          is a pirate that moves slower, other that cannot lift heavy pieces of
          the boat, another is color blind and the last one is deaf.
